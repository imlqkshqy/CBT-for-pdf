a super minimal to solve **all those PDFs you got from whatsoever sources**. You can quickly set up a custom test by choosing the number of questions and a time limit, and even pick the question type for each one.

Once you're in the test, a live timer keeps you on track. After you submit, you can input the answer key and the app instantly scores your exam and shows you exactly what you got right and wrong. It's a great way to turn static documents into a dynamic test.
